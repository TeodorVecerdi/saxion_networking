The main readme for this assignment is the assignment pdf on blackbloard.

This readme only contains some additional details on the files and assets that are being used.
You do not need this information to finish the assignment, it is only there for those of you that are interested.

_DontTouch	->	Assets that are used in the assignment under the surface
	Avatars	-> 
		All avatar models and animations used in the assignment (made by Dungeon Mason)
	Demigiant -> 
		The DoTween tweening engine used to implement all the awesome animations ;) (made by Demigiant)
	Editor/Extended Notes -> 
		A simple note component I wrote to add some documentation to the GameObjects here and there
	Fantasy Wooden GUI Free -> 
		Used on the chatpanel (made by Black Hammer)
	Hearthstone Speech Bubble Remake -> 
		Graphics and sounds I used to re-implement the HearthStone speech bubble.
		If you want to use this in a public project of your own, I recommend changing the graphics and the sound :).
	InGameDebugConsole -> 
		Awesome tool for in game debugging (made by Yasirkula)
	LowPolyFantasyVillage -> 
		Can no longer find this in the asset store.
	TextMeshPro -> 
		The improved text field, standard Unity package nowadays.

Prefabs
	AvatarView wraps both SpeechBubble and the other avatars
	SpeechBubble and the avatars are sort of explanatory

Scripts
	shared ->	
		The shared dll compiled by the server
	viewmanagement -> 
		Wrapper classes for the avatar area, the avatar view itself, panelwrapper and speechbubble.
		You can inspect these classes to see how they've been implemented, but you do NOT NEED to.
		Use these classes as blackboxes, since you only have limited time for this assignment.
